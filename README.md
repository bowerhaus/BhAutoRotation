BhAutoRotation for Gideros 
==========================

A class that uses the accelerometer to detect the orientation of the device and uses this
to change the orientation of the application.

As yet there is no demo project for this class but see the [blog entry](http://bowerhaus.eu/blog/files/multiple_device_orientations.html) for more information.

Example usage:
    BhAutoRotation.new(0.6, 0.1)
